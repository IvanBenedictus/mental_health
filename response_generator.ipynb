For the last 4 years, the porn and sex industry has been a huge factor in my life. At my \\u201cpeak\\u201d watching years, I would masturbate 3-4, sometimes 5-6 times a day, most of the time when I was just bored and had nothing to do. I would wake up in the middle of the night to masturbate. At one point, I had 30+ incognito tabs of different porn star profiles that I would rotate through. \\n\\nThen, a couple months ago, I started having problems. It would take me a while to get a solid erection, and when I did, my climax would be lackluster. I started to regret doing it every time I was done. I knew I had to stop, but I kept going. But now, with the new year coming in, I want to get this problem out of my life, and I just don\\u2019t know how. I had been eating correctly and working out almost every day for most of 2017, but there was also family issues in the last couple years as from about 2013 to now, my mom has been in and out of rehab for alcoholism. \\n\\nI\\u2019m just a teenager (15). The last thing I need is to have this problem hanging over especially with my role in the family increasing with my moms problems. If anyone has had any problems with this type of addiction and knows how to overcome it, I\\u2019m open to all suggestions. I\\u2019d rather not come out with the information to my dad, but if it would help my situation and help me come to terms with my addiction, I\\u2019ll do it.\\n\\n\",\n          \"My vyvanse addiction...

For the last 4 years, the porn and sex industry has been a huge factor in my life. At my \\u201cpeak\\u201d watching years, I would masturbate 3-4, sometimes 5-6 times a day, most of the time when I was just bored and had nothing to do. I would wake up in the middle of the night to masturbate. At one point, I had 30+ incognito tabs of different porn star profiles that I would rotate through. \\n\\nThen, a couple months ago, I started having problems. It would take me a while to get a solid erection, and when I did, my climax would be lackluster. I started to regret doing it every time I was done. I knew I had to stop, but I kept going. But now, with the new year coming in, I want to get this problem out of my life, and I just don\\u2019t know how. I had been eating correctly and working out almost every day for most of 2017, but there was also family issues in the last couple years as from about 2013 to now, my mom has been in and out of rehab for alcoholism. \\n\\nI\\u2019m just a teenager (15). The last thing I need is to have this problem hanging over especially with my role in the family increasing with my moms problems. If anyone has had any problems with this type of addiction and knows how to overcome it, I\\u2019m open to all suggestions.
